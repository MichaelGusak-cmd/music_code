# Music made with Code!
The idea came from the `Winnipeg Game Collective` music jam 2022, to explore integrating music and code together to create cool new sounds and experiences.

I learned that a lot of ways to make music in code are actually pretty simple, and I think it can be interesting to explore what we can do to make cool new music with code.

Here are some examples:

* [Web Audio Demos](https://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/)
* [Web Audio Playground](http://webaudioplayground.appspot.com/)

And here are some libraries that might be helpful:

* [Tuna.js](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna)
* [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/)
* [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/)
* [p5.sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.sound)
